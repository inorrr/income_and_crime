# How does crime rate relate to income in Canada?

The project site is live at https://inorrr.github.io/income_and_crime/. 

Understanding the relationship between crime rates and income in Canada is crucial for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and social welfare programs. Exploring this correlation can shed light on the socioeconomic factors driving criminal behavior and help formulate targeted interventions to alleviate poverty and reduce crime. Additionally, elucidating this connection can inform broader discussions on social inequality, justice, and community well-being in Canadian society.
